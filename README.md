# Computational-Intelligence
This repository contains implementations of different computational intelligence algorithms in Python and Java.

## Neural Networks ( Python Notebook )
The Python notebook in this repository implements a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and a self-organizing map (SOM). The notebook includes two datasets for comparison, and the results of running the FFNN and SOM algorithms on the datasets are displayed and compared.

## Evolutionary Algorithm ( Java Code )
The Java code in this repository implements an evolutionary algorithm for solving graph problems. The code provides a flexible framework for defining different graph problems and parameters for the evolutionary algorithm, and the results of running the algorithm on a specific problem can be displayed and analyzed.

## Getting Started
To run the code in this repository, you will need to have the necessary software installed on your machine, such as Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Java. The specific requirements for each implementation are detailed in the README file in each subfolder.
